# TensorflowOD

This project is based on Evan's work in [TensorFlow Lite Object Detection on Android and Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi). The code is modified to train the Tensorflow Lite Object Detection model in Linux using a single shell script.
